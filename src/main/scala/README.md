# S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

These are my solutions to a set of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland.

The problems have different levels of difficulty. Those marked with a single asterisk ( * ) are easy, problems marked with two asterisks ( ** ) are of intermediate difficulty, problems marked with three asterisks ( *** ) are the most difficult. 

The goal is to find the most elegant solution to the given problems. Efficiency is important, but clarity is even more crucial. Some of the (easy) problems can be trivially solved using built-in functions. However, in these cases, you learn more if you try to find your own solution.

This description and problems themselves are adapted from that [source](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/).
